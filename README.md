This is a _personal_ project amongst some friends to track the fermentation progress of beer from a bluetooth-connected Tilt hydrometer.  

Code in this repo is provided as-is with no support or documentation.  Use at your own risk.  If you've come seeking high-quality, well-tested, easy-to-use code, you're in the wrong place.  

This project is split into a few modules, each intended to run on different devices, but interconnected by the spec file produced by the `tilt-webservice`.
